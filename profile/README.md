## Welcome to SIL 👋

Sequential Intelligence Lab (SIL) is a UVA-based group focusing on theory and applications of RL directed by Prof. [Shangtong Zhang](https://shangtongzhang.github.io).  
The most exciting works from SIL are:


* [The ODE Method for Stochastic Approximation and Reinforcement Learning with Markovian Noise](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07844)
* [Transformers Learn Temporal Difference Methods for In-Context Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13861)
